          <p>Project Sunshine empowers a dynamic corps of over 15,000 volunteers to bring programming - recreational, educational and social service (HIV and nutritional counseling) - to 100,000 children facing medical challenges and their families in 175 cities across the US, Canada, China, Israel and Kenya.
          Volunteers selflessly donate their time to create program materials and deliver programs. Working onsite, our volunteers relieve the anxiety of the young patients and in a context of fun and play, foster in them the courage and coping skills necessary to confront procedures that lie ahead.
          Project Sunshine volunteers spread sunshine, restoring a crucial sense of normalcy to the pediatric healthcare environment..</p>

            Volunteers over the age of 21 will be matched with children between the ages of 7-17 living in all five boroughs.
            Currently, there’s a high demand for male volunteers to be matched with boys on the waitlist, and willingness to travel to the outer boroughs is a plus.</p>

      Hippotherapy is a physical, occupational, and speech-language therapy treatment that utilizes equine movement as part of an integrated intervention program to achieve functional goals. Specially trained therapy professionals evaluate each potential rider on an individual basis to determine the appropriateness of including hippotherapy as a treatment strategy. The therapist then draws up a treatment plan deciding which horse, equipment and activities will promote the riders confidence and overall functional abilities. Therapists with this training know how to manipulate various aspects of the horse's movement that will translate to the rider reaching there goals. </p>
